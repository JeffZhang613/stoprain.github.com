		<h1>Think big</h1>
		<p>Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir menâ€™s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and you beacon beauty. Think big.</p>
